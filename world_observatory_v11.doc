This is a simple model of observatory image quality and cost.  The seeing 
conditions of mid-latitude sites are estimated using the empirical model 
of Racine (2004,'Altitude, Elevation and Seeing', a report to the Large-
aperture Synoptic Survey Telescope).  Only boundary-layer seeing and 
free-atmosphere seeing are included in this model; scaled by telescope
height above the ground and observatory altitude above sea level.  Dome 
seeing is ignored.  The seeing at the polar site is taken to be that 
reported for Dome C in Lawrence et al. (2004, Nature, 411, 278) plus the
same model of ground-layer seeing, but improved by a given factor.  Total
observatory cost is estimated (very crudely) from user-defined unit costs
for roadway, enclosure, telescope, and adaptive optics (AO).

The results are displayed as point-source detection signal-to-noise ratio.
The plus sign represents the diffraction limit of an unobstructed circular 
telescope of the specified diameter.  The total cost to achieve this 
assumes, in part, sufficient AO actuators to reach diffraction-limited
performance.  This is estimated by requiring one actuator per Fried diameter
at the specified wavelength.  The other observatory costs are estimated in 
a similar manner.  The roadway cost is simply the length of access road 
multiplied by its per-kilometer expense.  The enclosure cost assumes a 
hemispherical dome with a cylindrical base, both with the same per-area
cost.  The enclosure base is set to be the same height as the telescope 
pier, but note that for any pier height the telescope cost remains the per-
area telescope cost multiplied by the aperture.

For comparison, the image quality and cost of a conventional telescope is
shown.  This is a telescope without AO - that is, limited by the natural 
seeing.  The image quality for this option is just the seeing at the 
telescope height scaled to the observed wavelength.
